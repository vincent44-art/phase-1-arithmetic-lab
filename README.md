# Review: Arithmetic Lab

## Learning Goals

* Recognize the limitations of math in JavaScript
* Employ operators to perform arithmetic and assign values to variables
* Explain what `NaN` is
* Use built-in objects like `Math` and `Number` to accomplish complex tasks

## Introduction

We're going to discuss a number of the common operators and objects we'll use to
perform arithmetic operations in JavaScript.

In the browser's JavaScript console, we can test out all of the examples in this
lesson. Remember that we can't redeclare variables previously declared with
`const` or `let`, so the page may have to be refreshed (which wipes away all
declared variables) or different variable names can be chosen than those in the
examples.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already, fork and clone this lab into your local environment.
Remember to **fork** a copy into your GitHub account first, then **clone** from
that copy. Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to
open the files in Visual Studio Code.

Next, run `npm install` to install the dependencies then run the test suite with
the `npm test` command.

## Recognize the Limitations of Math in JavaScript



After you have all the tests passing, remember to commit and push your changes
up to GitHub, then submit your work to Canvas using CodeGrade. If you need a
reminder, go back to the [Completing and Submitting Assignments with
CodeGrade][completing-codegrade] lesson to review the process.
